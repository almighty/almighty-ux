## Local Development
Want to submit a PR to our site? Run the environment locally using the steps below:

### First Time Build
1. Verify that you have the following installed:
    - Node
    - Gulp
    - Gem
    - Jekyll
2. run `gem install bundler`
3. run `npm install`
4. run `gulp`
    - this will copy the files from your 
    npm_modules directory to their respective 
    locations for the jekyll build process
5. run `jekyll build`
6. run `jekyll serve`
    - for viewing locally at http://localhost:4000

### Subsequent Builds
1. Run the npm command `npm run site`

### Troubleshooting
If you are having issues with the site building, you can run two sets of clean commands:

- `gulp cleanVendors`
    - This will remove the vendor files that were copied over during the `gulp` process
- `npm run clean`
    - This will remove your node_modules directory, run `npm install`, run `gulp cleanVendors` to remove any old vendor files, and run `gulp` to copy updated vendor files.

If you have issues with your gem bundles, you can run the following command:
- `npm run bundle`
    - This will update the gem bundles. If you do not have node installed, just run `bundle update`.
